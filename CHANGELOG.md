# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are recorded here, newest first, in the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) form. Every pull request adds its line
under **Unreleased** (AGENTS.md, code review rule 10, since 2026-10-20); a tag moves that section
under a dated heading. `ade update` (proposal 4.4 item 9) prints the entries between the commit a
machine last applied and the head it is moving to, so this file is what tells an operator or an
agent what changed and what is new. Entries end with the pull request number.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `loadwatch` skill and `load-watch watcher set|show|clear|test`: one registered agent session (a Paseo
  agent by `paseo send`, else relay.py) also hears every load incident, unexplained sustained load and
  job-guard trip, and investigates; `set` replaces the old watcher and tells it (2026-10-20).
- `docs/ade-everywhere-inventory-2026-10-20-stores.md`: Phase 0 slice 1, every installed agent
  session store classified (52 stores, backup plan per store, differences from proposal §6.1) (#16).
- `CHANGELOG.md`, this file, and the rule that every pull request adds a line to it; README
  "Update (this machine)"; proposal v2.4 with `ade update` as a Phase 1 command and acceptance
  test T8 (2026-10-20).
- `docs/threat-model.md`, the threat model Codex's security review reads (#10).
- AGENTS.md "Code review" section: what a reviewer checks on every pull request here (#9).
- `bin/cursor-cloud`: launch and inspect Cursor Cloud Agents from the terminal, with unit tests
  and a doc page (#5, #8).
- Load gate: no slice starts on a hot machine (`load-watch admit` plus the `acp-dispatch` gate)
  (#7).
- `acp-dispatch`: a `cursor-cloud` place (record, poller, report) and the matching
  `route_agent` service (#11).
- CI runs the pytest suite on ubuntu-latest as well as macOS (#3).
- `herdr-tidy`: Orca host mode (`--host orca`, `/orca-tidy`) (#2).

### Changed

- `acp-dispatch check`: a slice whose recorded class is `killed:` or `lost` gets the `resume` hint (no
  "after the reset") and no `--escalate`; a missing agent binary is `NO-REPORT: not-installed` (exit 127
  plus acp-run's own line) with a re-dispatch hint; `acp-run` waits up to 90 s (`ACP_RUN_BIN_WAIT`, clamped
  to 0..600, junk is the default) for a missing binary and preflight allows for that wait; re-dispatching a
  footed brief under a new `--name` carries one delivery contract, cutting only a provably generated tail
  and saying so on stderr (#18).
- `route_agent`: pool state comes from `aiuse --available --json`, with the snapshot file as the
  fallback (#12).
- `steps` skill: prompt-tool table and §2c cover the `question` tool so `/loose → /steps`
  walks via `question` on OpenCode, not just `AskUserQuestion` (Claude class) /
  `clarify` (Hermes) / `request_user_input` (Codex). Universal skills `/loose`,
  `/handoff`, `/baton`, `/steps` were already reachable from every installed TUI
  (`skill-everywhere --check` all green); the change wires the chain on OpenCode.

### Fixed

- `diskfree` skill: the idle check for deleting a cache runs in the same command as the delete; a
  `target-shared` delete approved minutes earlier broke a live maturin build (2026-10-20).
- `load-watch` job guard: a slow crash loop (60 failed restarts in 2 h) now trips too; litellm restarted
  every ~32 s for 19 h, just under the 20-in-10-min rule, and was never stopped (2026-10-20).
- `load-watch`: the registered watcher hears an unexplained sustained load at most hourly; Hermes keeps
  its 6 h cooldown (2026-10-20).
- `skill-everywhere`: the Hermes gateway nudge follows `hermes` wrappers to the real python; since `hermes`
  became a `/bin/sh` wrapper it ran the snippet under sh, where `import os, sys` was ImageMagick (2026-10-20).
- `tests/conftest.py` pins `ROUTE_AGENT_OMP_READY=0`, so the route_agent suite passes on a host with
  an omp login as it does on CI; the omp-ready roster has its own tests (queue item 6) (#17).
- `acp-dispatch`: an unmeasured (stale) quota window is skipped instead of crashing the dispatch
  with a `float(None)` error (#13).
- `self-slash` (herdr): a slash command left on the input line after the first Enter is Entered again, up to 3 times,
  for every TUI and not only cursor-agent; if it never leaves the line the waiter exits 8 and logs "NOT confirmed
- `firecrawl-router`: tokenless serving answers only a `Host` header that names the bound
  loopback server (DNS-rebinding allow-list), and the bearer compare is constant-time
  (`hmac.compare_digest`) (2026-10-22).

  run" instead of "sent" (2026-10-20).

### Security

- `firecrawl-router`: the serve-only form refuses a non-loopback `--listen` like `--open` does,
  and the address actually bound is checked before the first request is served (#14).
- `cursor-cloud` and `firecrawl-router`: endpoint variables must be https or loopback, bearer
  keys never follow a redirect or a client-chosen request target, and `cursor-cloud` runs under
  `python3 -I` with proxy, CA and `PYTHON*` variables scrubbed from the key-holding process (#15).
