# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are recorded here, newest first, in the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) form. Every pull request adds its line
under **Unreleased** (AGENTS.md, code review rule 10, since 2026-10-20); a tag moves that section
under a dated heading. `ade update` (proposal 4.4 item 9) prints the entries between the commit a
machine last applied and the head it is moving to, so this file is what tells an operator or an
agent what changed and what is new. Entries end with the pull request number.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md`, this file, and the rule that every pull request adds a line to it; README
  "Update (this machine)"; proposal v2.4 with `ade update` as a Phase 1 command and acceptance
  test T8 (2026-10-20).
- `docs/threat-model.md`, the threat model Codex's security review reads (#10).
- AGENTS.md "Code review" section: what a reviewer checks on every pull request here (#9).
- `bin/cursor-cloud`: launch and inspect Cursor Cloud Agents from the terminal, with unit tests
  and a doc page (#5, #8).
- Load gate: no slice starts on a hot machine (`load-watch admit` plus the `acp-dispatch` gate)
  (#7).
- `acp-dispatch`: a `cursor-cloud` place (record, poller, report) and the matching
  `route_agent` service (#11).
- CI runs the pytest suite on ubuntu-latest as well as macOS (#3).
- `herdr-tidy`: Orca host mode (`--host orca`, `/orca-tidy`) (#2).

### Changed

- `route_agent`: pool state comes from `aiuse --available --json`, with the snapshot file as the
  fallback (#12).
- `steps` skill: prompt-tool table and §2c cover the `question` tool so `/loose → /steps`
  walks via `question` on OpenCode, not just `AskUserQuestion` (Claude class) /
  `clarify` (Hermes) / `request_user_input` (Codex). Universal skills `/loose`,
  `/handoff`, `/baton`, `/steps` were already reachable from every installed TUI
  (`skill-everywhere --check` all green); the change wires the chain on OpenCode.

### Fixed

- `tests/conftest.py` pins `ROUTE_AGENT_OMP_READY=0`, so the route_agent suite passes on a host with
  an omp login as it does on CI; the omp-ready roster has its own tests (queue item 6) (#17).
- `acp-dispatch`: an unmeasured (stale) quota window is skipped instead of crashing the dispatch
  with a `float(None)` error (#13).

### Security

- `firecrawl-router`: the serve-only form refuses a non-loopback `--listen` like `--open` does,
  and the address actually bound is checked before the first request is served (#14).
- `cursor-cloud` and `firecrawl-router`: endpoint variables must be https or loopback, bearer
  keys never follow a redirect or a client-chosen request target, and `cursor-cloud` runs under
  `python3 -I` with proxy, CA and `PYTHON*` variables scrubbed from the key-holding process (#15).
