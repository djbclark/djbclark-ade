# Upstream issues worth filing

Drafts written 2026-08-23 from problems verified on this machine. Not yet
filed — filing is an operator decision (they go to third-party trackers under
the operator's account).

## 1. graft — statusline conflates "built but empty" with "not built"

**Repo:** `@nanonets/graft` (npm; installed globally at
`/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@nanonets/graft`)

**Version seen:** the globally installed build as of 2026-08-23.

**What happens:** In a repo whose indexed languages yield no code symbols —
e.g. a docs/markdown-only repo — `graft build` succeeds and legitimately
reports `✓ wiring: 0 nodes (), 0 edges, 0 cards []`. The Claude Code
statusline then renders:

```
◤ graft · not built · run graft build
```

...forever, because `renderStatusline()` treats `nodeCount === 0` as
"never built" (`dist/claude/format.js:24`), and `resolveStats()` falls back to
`readWiring()` which is also empty (`dist/claude/statusline.js`).

**Why it matters:** the bar tells the user to run a command they *have already
successfully run*, and keeps telling them after every rebuild. It reads as a
broken install. `graft ask` / `graft grep` still work fine, so the message is
actively misleading.

**Second, more common trigger found 2026-08-23** — this is not limited to
empty graphs. `graft check` reported `not built` for two repos with large,
fully working graphs (`~/ops/site-djbclark`, `~/ops/site-private`), where
`graft ask` returns correct symbol hits with file:line. The cause is that
`resolveStats()` reads `graft/.cache/stats.json`, which is written by the
**Claude Code hooks** — so any repo where the graph was built with a plain
`graft build`, without `graft init` having installed the hooks, has a
complete graph and no stats cache, and is reported as unbuilt.

That makes the failure mode much broader than "docs-only repo": it hits
every CLI-only user, every CI checkout, and every repo using graft without
the Claude integration. Worth fixing at the same place — persist a build
stamp from `graft build` itself rather than depending on a hook-written
cache, and distinguish "no graph" from "no stats".

**Suggested fix:** distinguish the two states. The build already knows whether
it ran, so persist that (a `builtAt` in `graft/.cache/stats.json`, or simply
the existence of the cache/stamp) and render empty-but-built differently, e.g.
`◤ graft · 0 nodes · no indexed code`. Falling back to "not built" only when
no build artifact exists at all.

**Repro:** `graft build` in any repo containing only `.md` files, then look at
the Claude Code statusline.

## 2. hindsight-coding-agents — documented config keys are a subset of what's read

**Package:** `@vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents` (0.3.4 on this machine)

**What happens:** the bundled `hindsight-coding-agent` skill documents a small
set of config keys for `~/.hindsight/coding-agent.json`, but the code reads
several more that are load-bearing for any non-default topology:

`optInOnly`, `optInPaths`, `retainTags`, `retainMetadata`, `bankIdTemplate`,
`resolveWorktrees`, `maxParallelRetains`, `daemonProfile`, `daemonIdleTimeout`,
`apiPort`, `embedPackagePath`, `embedVersion`

Also undocumented: `isOptedIn()` returns true for any path under `optInPaths`
**or** any `mapPathToBank` entry — a coupling that changes what a retention
allowlist actually does.

**Why it matters:** the default single-bank setup is a trap at scale. On this
machine one bank accumulated 1,756 facts across 7 unrelated projects, giving
roughly a 1-in-17 chance that a recalled memory came from the project the
agent was working in. Fixing that requires exactly the keys that aren't
documented, so users can't find the fix from the docs alone.

**Suggested fix:** document the full key set in the bundled skill, and call out
the `gitProjectName()` fallback — when `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` fails
it falls back to the directory basename, so `bankIdTemplate` silently produces
"drain banks" named after non-git parent directories (`::src`, `::tmp`, and
the home directory itself).

**Evidence:** measured on this machine and written up in
`~/ops/site-private/memory/project_hindsight_memory_restructure.md`.
