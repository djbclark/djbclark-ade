# bigteam — multi-vendor fan-out for one prompt

Turn one prompt into parallel work across every agent CLI on this machine,
spending the *cheapest adequate* pool for each slice and keeping Claude's own
window for what only it should do.

Two optimisation targets, both of them explicit operator goals:

1. **Token value** — don't spend Opus on mechanical edits, and never redo work
   already paid for.
2. **Multi-vendor monthly-plan use** — several subscriptions here reset monthly
   and go chronically unused. Idle quota is wasted money. Prefer a fresh
   subscription pool over Claude's 5-hour window for anything delegable.

This skill is the *method*. `model-routing` holds the verified headless
invocation forms and the billing-class map; read it, don't duplicate it here.

## Step 0 — another bigteam run may already be live

Another session may be running its own fan-out right now (often the herdr tab
labelled `coord`). The two share every quota pool and possibly the checkout, so
before slicing:

1. **Look.** `herdr tab list` (a `coord` tab, or any tab whose agent is
   `working` on a fan-out) and `ls -lt ~/.local/state/bigteam/` (task dirs
   touched in the last hour). Read each live dir's `CLAIM`.
2. **Claim.** Use a task name no live run uses, and write
   `~/.local/state/bigteam/<task>/CLAIM` before dispatching: session (herdr
   pane or Claude session id), repo, owned files, start time. Append `DONE`
   when you finish.
3. **Never overlap files.** A file another live claim owns is not yours to
   slice, edit, stage or format. In a shared repo, commit only your own paths,
   by path, after `git pull --rebase`; never touch the other run's uncommitted
   files.
4. **Pools are shared.** Re-probe `aiuse --available` right before each batch
   (the other run drains the same windows), leave headroom, and don't put both
   runs on a burst-limited pool at once (agy's ~60 requests/hour is machine-wide).
5. **Hands off its panes.** Never reuse, close or message the other run's
   tabs, panes or agents. To coordinate, tell its session (`session-finder`).

## Step 1 — probe, never assume

    aiuse --available        # usable pools only, one line per vendor AND model family, cache, <1 s
    aiuse --available --live # force a live collect (~30-60 s)
    cswap list               # Claude 5h / weekly / Fable

`aiuse --available` (aiuse 3.1.4+) prints only pools that can take work, sorted by
headroom, every window as "X% used / Y% left", with the data's age on its first
line. Exit 0 means usable pools exist, **3 means nothing is usable** (the data is
fine, the quota is not), 1 is a real error. It reads the snapshot cache that
`aiuse watch` and an hourly launchd job keep fresh, so you rarely need `--live`.
**Use the cache by default** (operator, 2026-10-06: slightly stale data saves a lot
of time). Take it as good enough when it says `fresh` (under ~25 min); add `--live`
only when it is older than that, or when the choice hinges on a pool that is near
empty or past its reset time since the snapshot. History: every collect is kept in
`~/.cache/aiuse/snapshots/` (and `ledger/`), so trends need no live call either. A pool missing from the list is exhausted or
suppressed: `aiuse --json -q | jq -r '.summary_lines[]'` shows every pool,
including the exhausted ones. Either way, preflight each target (item 5 below),
because no snapshot sees a pool drained in the last few minutes.
(`~/ops/site-private/bin/aiuse-pools` is a thin wrapper for the same command.)

### Reading the numbers — a misreading here already cost a dispatch round

`aiuse --available` and `aiuse --json` now encode items 1-3 in their output
(`state`, `usable_now`, `binding_window`, `pool_family`, "used / left" pairs), so
read those rather than re-deriving; the rules stay here for raw numbers from any
other source.

1. **`used_percent` is the share CONSUMED; 100 means empty.** Decide from
   `remaining_percent`, and never print or quote a bare percentage. On
   2026-10-03 `Codex 5-hour quota: 100` was read as "100% free" and a review was
   dispatched to an exhausted codex.
2. **An account is usable only if EVERY one of its windows has headroom** — the
   fullest window binds. Codex at 100% used on its 5-hour window and 35% on its
   weekly is unusable for the next ~5 hours, however healthy the weekly looks.
3. **One TUI can hold several independent pools, one per model family.** agy has
   a Gemini pool and a separate Claude/GPT pool; Claude has the ordinary and the
   Fable buckets; Cursor has Auto/included and "other models". A 429 is a
   statement about the pool that model draws on, not about the vendor. **Before
   reassigning a slice away from a vendor, retry it on a model from that
   vendor's other pool** (agy: a `gemini-*` model when a `claude-*` or `gpt-*`
   one returns `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`; `agy models` lists both). On 2026-10-03 the
   agy Claude/GPT pool was depleted while its Gemini pool had plenty left, and
   the slice was wrongly moved to another vendor. Pick the model by which pool
   is fresh, not only by which is strongest.
4. **Pool state moves within a session.** agy's Claude/GPT 5-hour window read
   0% used at probe time and was exhausted about 35 minutes later (weekly went
   0% to ~51%). That coincided with one Opus-high review dispatched to it, but
   other sessions also use agy, so the cause is inferred, not verified. Re-probe
   before every batch, not once per session, and treat a small pool as one that a
   single heavy slice may be able to spend.
5. **Preflight each target** before a batch: one trivial call through the exact
   invocation and model you will use (`... "Reply with exactly: OK"`). Any
   `usage limit`, `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` or 429 in the reply means that pool is
   spent: note the reset time it prints, then use the sibling pool or reassign.
6. **agy has a burst limit that `aiuse` cannot see, and its CLI and ACP clients
   fail independently** (incident 2026-10-03). Every `agy` CLI request got an
   instant 429 from 15:42 to past 23:50 while `aiuse` showed Gemini 5h 100% left
   and Claude+GPT 5h 100% left, and `acp-run agy` on the same account answered in
   6.5 s. Cause (inferred): about 304 CLI generation requests in 12:00 to 14:59
   against a prior busiest hour of 68; one `claude-opus-5-5-high` review was 47
   requests alone. So for an agy slice: **a)** budget roughly **60 requests an hour
   per login** (a tool-using turn is many requests), so one review an hour, not a
   fan-out; **b)** dispatch **only via `acp-run agy` — `agy -p` is not a
   fallback** (2026-10-04: the CLI surface stayed 429-locked 18+ hours with the
   Gemini 5h window 99% unused, through repeated re-logins — the throttle is
   client-keyed and survives login — while ACP worked throughout); **c)** send
   **no probe loops**, preflight
   once per batch and reuse the answer; **d)** keep Opus-high off agy except where
   nothing else fits (the Claude/GPT pool is small); **e)** if one client 429s while
   `aiuse` shows headroom, try the other client before reassigning; **f)** a log
   line `attempt N failed (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` in
   `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/log/cli-*.log` is a fast fail, not a hang, so stop
   and reassign. Detail: `model-routing` ("agy has a burst limit").

Classify every pool before assigning anything:

| class | meaning | use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **fresh subscription** | monthly/weekly window largely unused | bulk, mechanical, writing, research — use heavily |
| **tight** | >40% of the binding window burned | one slice at most, or skip |
| **exhausted** | `remaining_percent` ≈ 0 on ANY window of that pool | skip that pool entirely (the same vendor's other model-family pool may be fine) |
| **lifeline** | another agent runs on it | use with care and never let it run out; see *Reserve pools* below (clinepass and Claude itself) |
| **shared allowance** | a GitHub-side feature draws on the same subscription | usable, but spend modestly and keep a margin; see *Copilot* under *Reserve pools* below |
| **prepaid** | real money | never without a fresh explicit operator decision |
| **excluded** | operator has ruled it out | respect it, with its end condition (below) |

### Vendors come back on their own

Nothing here takes a vendor out of rotation for good (operator, 2026-10-06: "make
sure vendors are automatically used again when more tokens become available"):

1. **Exhausted pools** drop out of `aiuse --available` and reappear by themselves
   once the sampler's snapshot sees the reset. Never keep a private "skip X" list
   between batches; probe each batch.
2. **`aiuse note-exhausted`** overrides always carry a reset time and expire then.
3. **An operator exclusion** ("don't use agy for now") is recorded with its end
   condition: a date, or an event such as "until reinstalled" (`acp-run --list`
   shows `ok` again) or "until the burst-limit issue is fixed". Re-check the
   condition each batch; when it has passed, the vendor is back in the pool. If no
   end condition was given, ask for one rather than excluding indefinitely.

**Current exclusions** (keep this list short; delete an entry when it lapses):

1. **The grok vendor (xAI's SuperGrok subscription)** — excluded 2026-10-06,
   operator: "Stop using grok (the vendor) in /bigteams etc. for now. You can
   still use grok models via several other vendors." End condition: none —
   permanent until the operator explicitly lifts it (confirmed 2026-10-06); don't
   ask for an end date or re-check it per batch. Covers every route that bills SuperGrok: the `grok`
   TUI/CLI, `acp-run grok`, Ralph's `grok` plugin, and LiteLLM's `grok-sub`
   model (the `xai_oauth_bridge`). Grok *models* through another vendor's pool
   (opencode, cursor, copilot, …) stay allowed, under that pool's own rules
   (prepaid ones like openrouter still need a fresh operator decision).
   **Enforcement (2026-10-06):** `aiuse --available` omits it via
   `[analysis.excluded_pools] "grok"` in `~/.config/aiuse/config.toml` and
   lists it under `excluded` (aiuse a540f15); Hermes's `fallback_providers`
   no longer name `grok-sub` or `xai-oauth` (`~/.hermes/config.yaml`).
   Still open by choice: `acp-run --list` shows `grok`, and LiteLLM keeps
   `grok-sub` in other models' fallback chains (`roles/litellm`,
   `litellm_xai_bridge_enabled`). Lifting the exclusion means undoing the
   aiuse and Hermes entries too.

### Reserve pools — never run them out

These pools have something else depending on them. Running one dry breaks that
dependant, which costs more than any slice saves:

1. **clinepass** — Hermes runs on it, through the LiteLLM gateway on `:4000`.
   Never bulk-route to it.
2. **The grok TUI** (`grok`, the SuperGrok subscription) — GrokBot, the cloud
   "Chief of Staff", runs on it. **Currently excluded entirely** (see *Current
   exclusions* above); when that lapses, small slices only, window checked
   first. Grok *models* reached through another TUI (opencode, cursor,
   copilot, …) bill that TUI's pool instead and are fine.
3. **Claude** — do use it; it does the judgment, integration and review. But
   orchestration runs from Claude, so if its 5-hour or weekly window runs out,
   nothing else gets dispatched, integrated or committed either. Check
   `cswap list` before every batch, not once per session, and keep enough
   headroom to finish integrating what is already in flight.

If one of these is the only pool left for a slice, wait or ask; don't spend the
reserve.

**Copilot — lighter care, not a lifeline.** The `copilot` TUI draws on the same
GitHub Copilot subscription that GitHub-side features use, notably automatic
Copilot code review of commits to `master` (djbclark's note of 2026-07-30), so a
drained allowance can also stop those reviews. Be careful, but far less than
with clinepass: nothing of the operator's runs on it, it is not a bulk pool
(its direct-use allowance is small), and it is opt-in only for slices that lean
on GitHub context. Check its remaining premium requests first and give it one
small slice at most, never a whole batch.

Ignore `aiuse`'s `kind:"conserve"` pace alerts for go/no-go; they fire on a fast
hour even when the window is nearly untouched.

## Step 2 — slice by file, not by topic

A fan-out only works if slices cannot collide. The partition rule:

> **Every file has exactly one owner for the duration of the batch.**

Topic slices overlap; file slices don't. Derive the partition from the files the
work actually touches, then name the owned paths explicitly in each prompt. Two
agents in the same file will silently lose each other's edits.

Prefer one shared checkout with strict file ownership over a worktree per agent:
disjoint files in one tree need no merge, and merging five branches costs more
than it saves at this granularity. Reach for `cow-workspaces` or
`git worktree` only when slices genuinely must touch the same file.

Keep for **yourself** (the orchestrator), never delegate:

- anything security-relevant, or any change whose blast radius you'd have to
  verify anyway
- the final integration, every diff review, all tests, and all commits
- any decision that removes a feature the operator deliberately built

## Step 3 — the concurrency contract

Every dispatched prompt carries the same hard rules. They exist because each one
has already been violated by a real agent on this machine:

- Edit **only** the listed files. Report anything else, don't fix it.
- **No git writes** — no add/commit/checkout/stash/restore/reset/rebase/clean.
  Read-only git is encouraged.
- **No test suite, no repo-wide formatter or linter.** The orchestrator runs
  tests centrally. A stray `ruff --fix .` rewrites other agents' files.
- Leave changes **uncommitted**. The orchestrator commits, staged **by path** —
  `git add -A` in a shared checkout stages other sessions' in-flight work.
- No package installs, no new directories, no scratch files inside the repo.
- **Verify before acting.** Findings handed to an agent were written by another
  AI. Tell it so, and tell it that reporting a finding as wrong is a better
  outcome than a confident wrong edit.
- Report in a fixed shape: `CHANGED:` / `SKIPPED:` / `NOTES:` / `DONE`.

## Step 4 — dispatch, and make sure you are told when each slice finishes

Learning that an agent finished is the part that fails silently, so it is
designed here rather than left to chance.

**The rule: each slice is a FOREGROUND command inside its own Bash call with
`run_in_background: true`. Never end a command by launching a `&` job, and never
poll with `pgrep -f`.** The harness tracks a `run_in_background` call and
re-invokes you the moment it exits. A job backgrounded only by a shell `&` is
invisible to it: verified 2026-10-03, such a job ran to completion and produced
no notification at all, and the batch sat finished for over an hour until it was
next checked. `acp-run` does not change this; it is an ordinary command, and ACP
only makes its own exit code and stop reason trustworthy.

Send every slice in **one message as parallel Bash calls**, each
`run_in_background: true`, so each reports as it finishes and the first results
arrive first. **For every agent that speaks ACP, dispatch through `acp-run`**
(`~/ops/site-private/bin/acp-run`; agent list, flags and current status in
`model-routing`):

    acp-run <agent> -C <repo> -f "$OUT/brief-<name>.md" --model <m> \
        --perm scoped:<owned file>,<owned file> --timeout 1500 \
        --log "$OUT/<name>.jsonl" > "$OUT/out-<name>.txt" 2> "$OUT/sum-<name>.txt"

(`$OUT` is `~/.local/state/bigteam/<task>/`, outside the repo; owned paths are
relative to `-C`. No trailing `&`: the Bash call itself is the background job.)
**Not the session scratchpad:** it is wiped when the session restarts, and on
2026-10-05 that took a batch's briefs and outputs with it mid-run. Briefs,
outputs, logs and diffs for a fan-out live under `~/.local/state/bigteam/<task>/`
until the work is committed or recorded in a repo.

1. **`--perm scoped:<owned files>`** turns Step 2's one-owner-per-file rule into
   a per-call check: an edit outside the slice's paths is refused, not just
   discouraged. It binds only agents that send permission requests (copilot and
   cline do; claude, cursor and opencode mostly auto-allow by their own
   settings, so give those a stricter `--mode` where `--info` offers one, and
   still check the diff). Use `--perm deny` for review-only slices.
2. **Always `--model`.** The default is the agent's own, which for the claude
   adapter is the expensive settings model.
3. **One `--log` per slice**, so the event log (every tool call and permission
   decision) can be read when a slice goes wrong. `sum-<name>.txt` gets the
   one-line summary: stop reason, tool calls, permissions allowed/denied,
   tokens, cost.
4. Exit 124 is a timeout (acp-run cancels the session first); exit 1 is an
   agent error or other stop reason.

For agents with no working ACP route (zcode, crush, muse), and as a fallback for
agy when its ACP client fails (it fails independently of the CLI), use the
per-CLI form from `model-routing`, with **stdin closed** and a `timeout` guard:

    { timeout 1500 <tui-invocation> < /dev/null; echo "---<name> exit=$?"; } > out-<name>.txt 2>&1

— again as its own `run_in_background: true` call, no `&`.

**One notification for the whole batch, if you prefer it:** a single
`run_in_background` call that starts the slices with `&` and ends in `wait`. The
`&` is fine there because the outer call is the tracked one; you get one event,
when the slowest slice ends. The broken shape is a call whose last act is
launching a `&` job: it returns at once, so the harness reports it done
immediately (false-early) or, without `run_in_background`, never reports it.

**Waiting on something that is not itself a tracked command** (a report file
another process will write) — run the wait as a `run_in_background` call and
bound it, so a file that never appears cannot hang forever:

    timeout 1800 bash -c 'until [ -s "$OUT/report-x.md" ]; do sleep 10; done'

**Never write the wait as `until ! pgrep -f '<pattern>'`.** `pgrep -f` matches
the waiting shell's own command line, which contains `<pattern>`, so it always
finds itself and the loop never exits. On 2026-10-03 two such waiters ran for
1.5 hours and the only notification was the one produced by killing them. For
liveness use the PID (`kill -0 $pid`) or `wait`; for completion, wait on the
report file or the `---<name> exit=` line.

**A slice that fails on quota** (429, `usage limit`, `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`) is
Step 1 item 3: try the same vendor's other model-family pool before reassigning.
Then **tell the next agent**, so it does not walk into the same wall:
`aiuse note-exhausted <provider> [--family <gemini|claude_gpt|fable|...>]
--resets-in 4h53m [--reason '<the 429 text>']` (or `--resets-at <ISO>`). It is an
advisory override that expires at the reset time and shows up in
`aiuse --available` as `source: agent-reported`. Only record what a call really
returned; do not guess a reset time.

## Step 5 — integrate, and trust nothing on faith

- **Exit 0 is not success.** A file holding only a preamble, or a reviewer
  returning no findings, is a failed run. Check for an actual report. This holds
  for `acp-run` too: an agent can end its turn normally with a provider error
  as its whole reply. The summary line's permissions-denied count shows a slice
  that tried to leave its files.
- Read every diff yourself before committing. Agents are good and still get
  ordering, alphabetisation and scope wrong.
- Run the tests centrally, once, after the batch settles.
- When an agent refutes part of its own brief, that is the system working —
  prefer its evidence over your assumption, and say so.
- A slice that fails on tooling (not on the work) gets **reassigned to a
  different vendor**, not retried on the same one. The exception is a quota
  failure on one model-family pool: retry on the same vendor's other pool first
  (Step 1 item 3), because the vendor itself is not spent.

## Step 6 — second opinion on contract decisions

For a protocol/contract/API decision, or any recommendation to delete
functionality, get one independent opinion from a **differently sourced** vendor
than the one that proposed it, and make it adversarial: tell it not to defer,
and ask it to check each claim with file:line evidence. Then put the decision in
front of the operator if it removes something they deliberately built.

## Known failure modes, already paid for

| symptom | cause | action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `copilot` hangs or `shared writer lock ... changed` | headless `--allow-all-tools` disables itself when it can't reach a policy server, then waits for an approval no TTY can give | reassign the slice; keep copilot timeout-bounded |
| `agy` CLI returns `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (code 429)` on every model while `aiuse` shows headroom, or looks hung for ~2m20s | per-client burst limit on the CLI login (2026-10-03: ~304 requests in 3 h); the CLI retries 8 times in-process, and `--print-timeout` cuts it with exit 0 and partial output | stop; `grep 'attempt [0-9]* failed' ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/log/cli-*.log`; use `acp-run agy` or reassign; do not loop probes |
| `agy` runs with a flag as its prompt | `-p` is a required-value string flag | always `-p='<prompt>'`; a non-zero exit here is the guard working |
| `zcode` hangs with ~0 CPU | `--mode build`/`edit` gates tools behind an impossible approval | default yolo only; `ZCode Built-in skipped` on stderr is benign |
| `opencode.json` turns up modified | every `opencode run` rewrites it in cwd | `git checkout -- opencode.json`, or avoid in tracked repos |
| `opencode/*` model fails on funds | that's the prepaid Zen catalogue | use `opencode-go/*` for the free bundle |
| a stray empty dir appears | agy has done this | `git status --porcelain` after every batch |
| `acp-run` exits 1 with `FAILED quota/plan/auth/transient` (or 5: empty reply, every permission denied) | since 2026-10-05 acp-run detects provider failures that arrive as a normal `end_turn` (plan-gated reply, reply cut off by a transport error, quota text); `reply truncated; edits may be present` means check the tree | read the stderr line and the log; reassign the slice or wait for the pool; for truncated, review what was edited |
| no notification when an agent finishes | it was launched with a trailing shell `&` and no `run_in_background` call, so the harness is not tracking it | run each slice as a foreground command in its own `run_in_background: true` call (Step 4) |
| a wait loop never ends | `until ! pgrep -f '<pattern>'` matches its own shell | wait on the report file, a PID or `wait`; bound it with `timeout` |
| `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / "usage limit" from a vendor you thought had headroom | `used_percent` read as free; or the pool was drained since the probe; or that model family's pool is spent while a sibling pool is fine | decide from `remaining_percent`, preflight, re-probe per batch, retry on the sibling model family |

## What this skill is not for

A single-file edit, a lookup, or anything where the coordination overhead
exceeds the work. Fan-out has a real fixed cost: writing the slices, enforcing
the contract, reviewing the diffs. Don't count slices to decide, though: a
discrete task that would read many files, logs or long outputs into this
session belongs in a fan-out even as one or two slices, because keeping this
context small is itself the goal (2026-10-08). Do it yourself only when the
work is small enough that its tokens cost less than the brief and review.
