  Do anything in BarnOwl or Zephyr from plain English: list or change
  subscriptions, read logs, locate someone, send a zephyr, or run a BarnOwl
  command in the live client. Use when the user asks to list subscriptions,
  subs, zwrite, a zephyr class, or anything in BarnOwl or Zephyr.

# BarnOwl, in plain English

Turn the request into the smallest real BarnOwl or Zephyr operation and run it.
The helper is `scripts/bo` in this skill (`~/src/djbclark-ade/skills/barnowl/scripts/bo`).
The command list is `bo run 'show commands'`; a command's flags are in
`bo run 'help COMMAND'`, or in `commands.c` of
[github.com/barnowl/barnowl](https://github.com/barnowl/barnowl) (the `OWLCMD_*`
name and its summary string). The installed client is BarnOwl 1.10.
`~/src/barnowl` is **not** the client source: it is djbclark's modules repo
(forgejo.mit.edu/djbclark/barnowl): `Goose`, `HistoryLoad`, `InstanceStyle`
and the `bo-a` launcher.

Inside BarnOwl the user has `:goose <request>` (plain English, from the
`Goose` module); this skill is the same idea for an agent outside the client.
`subs` means subscriptions.

## Which client

The persistent BarnOwl is the tmux session `barnowl`, started and repaired by
`bo-a` (`~/src/barnowl/bin/bo-a`, installed to `~/.local/bin/bo-a` by that
repo's `install.sh`; the operator runs it). `bo` talks only to that session.
A second `barnowl` process may be sitting on another tty. Do not type into it.

The properly configured BarnOwl is on `pastebin.xvm.mit.edu`. The Mac has no
live session, so run `bo` there (`ssh pastebin.xvm.mit.edu`).

`zctl retrieve` fails here (`No such file or directory while finding
WindowGram port`) because BarnOwl, not zwgc, holds the port. Live
subscriptions come from `bo subs`.

## Safety

Do the thing the sentence asks for.

- A read (`bo subs`, `bo file`, `bo locate`, `bo capture`, reading `~/zlog`,
  `getvar`) runs immediately.
- Subscribe, unsubscribe, punt, or change a startup command only when the
  sentence asks to change that subscription or setting.
- Send a zephyr only when the sentence asks to send one, and send only the
  text it gives. Personal zephyrs go to a user. Class zephyrs need the class
  it names. Do not invent a message.
- `quit`, `unsuball`, and `zctl cancel` only when the sentence says to leave
  or drop every subscription.
- If `bo` exits 3, BarnOwl is mid-compose or already on a command line. Say so
  and stop. Do not send more keys.

## What to run

| Request | Run |
|---|---|
| list subscriptions, my subs, what am I on | `bo subs` |
| subscriptions that will reload next start | `bo file` (same text as `~/.zephyr.subs`) |
| subscribe to a class | `bo run 'sub CLASS * *'` |
| subscribe for this session only | `bo run 'sub -t CLASS * *'` |
| unsubscribe | `bo run 'unsub CLASS * *'` |
| where is a person | `bo locate USER` |
| recent personals or a class log | read `~/zlog/people/USER` or `~/zlog/class/CLASS` |
| send | `bo run 'zwrite ... -m TEXT'` with the flags from `help zwrite` |
| any other BarnOwl command | `bo run '<command>'` |
| a value only Perl can see | `bo perl '<expression>'` (one expression) |

`bo subs` prints Zephyr triples `<class,instance,recipient>`. The server adds
personals (`message,personal,…` and `message,*,…`) that are not lines in
`~/.zephyr.subs`. When the user asks for "my subs", print the `bo subs` list.
Mention the file only when they ask what is saved, or when a live triple is
not in the file and that difference matters.

Instance and recipient default to `*` on `sub` and `unsub`. The personal class
is `message`, instance `personal`. A class zephyr is `zwrite -c CLASS -i
INSTANCE`. A personal is `zwrite USER`. `-m` must be the last zwrite argument.

`bo run` prints the type window. If the command opens a pager (show, help,
getsubs), `bo` prints that screen and closes it with `q`. Prefer `bo subs`
over `:getsubs` so the pager does not flash.

Logs are already on: `~/.owl/startup` sets logging, classlogging, and
loggingdirection. New log text is under `~/zlog/`.

Tickets are Kerberos. If a send or `bo subs` says the ticket is gone, say so
and stop. Do not run `kinit`.

## On this machine

`bo` is `scripts/bo`; link the skill into every agent client with
`~/src/djbclark-ade/bin/skill-everywhere barnowl` (the same command on
pastebin, from its own `~/src/djbclark-ade` checkout).

## Answer

Print the command result, not a retelling of the procedure. For a subscription
list, one triple per line, class then instance then recipient. For a send,
say who it went to and the exact text.
