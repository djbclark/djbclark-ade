"""bigteam-prune.py: remove finished fan-out checkouts under ~/.local/state/bigteam without losing work or reports
(skills/diskfree step 7; operator's go first).

This script DELETES directories, so every check fails closed: any error, timeout or doubt keeps the checkout.

Only task dirs (real directories directly under the root, never symlinks, never resolving outside it) at least 7 days
old, with no CLAIM file (a CLAIM that records DONE still blocks) and no unfinished job record (jobs/*.json without
`finished`). Inside them, a git checkout is removed only when ALL of this holds:
  - git itself says the checkout's top level is that directory (a broken `.git` never falls through to an enclosing
    repository), with every GIT_* environment variable cleared for every git call;
  - nothing in the checkout changed in the last 7 days (newest mtime of the directory, index, HEAD, HEAD reflog,
    FETCH_HEAD), and no rebase, merge, cherry-pick, revert, bisect or sequencer is in progress;
  - `git status --porcelain=v1 -z --ignored=matching` run with untracked files forced on and submodules never ignored
    lists nothing but ignored paths; no tracked file is marked assume-unchanged or skip-worktree; no submodule;
  - at least one remote is configured, and no remote URL (fetch or push, insteadOf applied) is, or might be, a path
    inside the bigteam root (sibling checkouts that fetch each other would count each other's unpushed commits as "on
    a remote"): `file://` URLs are percent-decoded as git does, scp-like `host:path` and ssh hosts are resolved with
    `ssh -G` for the URL's own user and port; only a host that resolves to addresses none of which is this machine's (loopback, or an interface
    address, tested by binding) counts as another machine; anything else (a local name, an alias `ssh -G` cannot
    resolve, a name that does not resolve, `x::y` helper transports, odd schemes, `file://otherhost/...`) keeps the
    checkout;
  - an IGNORED path is only allowed when it is a known generated directory (node_modules .venv venv __pycache__
    .pytest_cache .mypy_cache .ruff_cache) holding no nested git repository and no unreadable subdirectory and no bare repository (HEAD+objects+refs) anywhere inside; any other
    ignored file or directory (a report, an `out.rc`, a database, a scratch repo, anything under `.cache`) keeps the
    checkout;
  - the git dir holds only git's standard entries (a note, a custom hook, an LFS store, a customised info/exclude in
    `.git` keeps the checkout); `.git/config` content is not preserved or judged;
  - a linked worktree: a standard `<main>/.git/worktrees/NAME` worktree whose HEAD is on a remote-tracking branch, with no
    refs/worktree, refs/bisect or refs/rewritten ref and nothing in its HEAD reflog that is missing from the remote,
    branch and tag refs (`git worktree remove` deletes both); it is removed with `git worktree remove` (no --force)
    from its main repository, so its branch stays there;
  - a clone: `git worktree list` lists only itself, no stash, and nothing in ANY ref (branches, tags, notes, HEAD, so a
    detached HEAD too) or reflog is missing from the remote-tracking refs.
"On a remote" means the local remote-tracking refs; they are never fetched or verified, so a branch deleted upstream, or
a remote that is a local path outside the root, still counts. A repository borrowing objects from a clone
(`git clone --shared`, objects/info/alternates) cannot be detected from the clone's side. Right before each deletion (and again after the safety scan) the task
dir is re-judged (still a real dir under the root, mtime unchanged since planning apart from our own removals, no
CLAIM, no unfinished, resume-pending or unreadable job record; the 7-day age is qualified once, at planning) and the checkout's safety is re-checked; a clone that fails part way through rmtree is left half deleted (it was clean and pushed).
`--apply` takes an exclusive lock (`bigteam-prune.lock` beside the root) and exits 3 when another run holds it.
A clone with a ref, a root pseudo-ref (FETCH_HEAD, ORIG_HEAD, ...) or a linked worktree's reflog entry pointing at a
blob, a tree or a missing object is kept. An http(s), ftp or git remote counts as another machine only
when no proxy or address override applies (http.curloptResolve, http.proxy, remote.X.proxy, core.gitProxy, *_PROXY,
GIT_PROXY_COMMAND). A linked worktree's HEAD reflog is read on both sides of every entry. An ssh remote counts as another machine only when
git's ssh is plain ssh (no core.sshCommand, GIT_SSH, GIT_SSH_COMMAND, ProxyCommand or ProxyJump). Kept reasons print
remote URLs without userinfo, path, query or helper-transport arguments (network URLs as scheme, host and port only).
Every commit named by a root pseudo-ref in the git dir (ORIG_HEAD, FETCH_HEAD, REBASE_HEAD, ...) must also be on a
remote (a linked worktree: or a branch or tag), and no directory below the checkout may be a git repository of its own
(a `.git` entry or a bare repository), tracked or not.
Everything kept is printed with its reason.
